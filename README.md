<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The purpose of CoBu (Co-op-Buddy-up) is for gamers looking for team mates in co-op enabled games to find others who have the same games and availability. The plan is that they could add a list of games and free times in order to see how many other people are also looking via a main calendar. The next step would be a way to form a chat between team mates so they can talk among themselves and share passwords to private games or servers.</p>

<h3>Target Audience:</h3>
<p>The target audience for CoBu would be anyone looking to find people to join for co-op sessions, or to form sessions that others could ask to join. This would help to encourage teamwork, tactics and cut down negative experiences that can arise by joining random sessions. 

Ideally, there would be a way to create sessions and describe the kind of team that you're looking to form. Once others are accpeted, a private group chat would allow the team to communicate before/after starting any sessions.</p>

<h2>User Stories</h2>

<h3>Must-Have User Stories</h3>
<h4>User Story 1</h4> 
<p>User 1 is looking for a group of people to join but doesn't feel comfortable jumping into random sessions in progress. Ideally, they would like something that indicates that any teams with free spaces are like-minded and pretty casual in their playstyle.</p>

<p>Acceptance Criteria: User 1 would like it if all matching sessions had a tag system and/or description to clearly indicate the expected playstyle of potential team mates</p>

<h4>User Story 2</h4>
<p>User 2 would like to find a group of people who play the same games fairly frequently, but don't take themselves too seriously or get overly competetive. If the game calls for it, they would like to chat about what role each play could assume before jumping into the game.</p>

<p>Acceptance Criteria: User 2 would like to see the availability and frequency of the sessions, so see if it would be as often as they would like. It would also be good to know if they communicate often.</p>

<h4>User Story 3</h4>
<p>User 3 wants to compete in public tournaments and only wants other highly competetive players to join the sessions designed for practice and/or trials. It would be expected that the group chat can only be accessed by memebers so that passwords, sessions names aren't visible by anyone without permission.</p>

<p>Acceptance Criteria: User 3 wants an option to make sure only accepted people can join the group chat or see what is being posted. At least they want to be able to send private messages to the group memebers if they wish to keep passwords to servers secret from the public.</p>
